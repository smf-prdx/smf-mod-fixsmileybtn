# smf-mod-fixsmileybtn

A SimpleMachines Forum (SMF) 2.1.x modification to hack the CSS of the smileys popup.

---

## 📌 Description

**smf-mod-fixsmileybtn** is a lightweight, hook-only modification for SMF 2.1.x. No patching is necessary, and it's designed to install cleanly alongside other mods.

This tweak modifies the CSS for the SCEditor smileys popup, which appears when users click the “More” button in the post editor. In forums with many (and possibly large) smileys, the default layout places the Close button at the very bottom, forcing users to scroll all the way down to dismiss the popup — not ideal.

This mod solves the problem by pinning the Close button to the bottom of the popup, keeping it visible at all times regardless of scroll position. Browsing smileys becomes smoother and more intuitive, especially in large collections.

## 📥 Installation

To install the mod:

1. Go to the [latest release page](https://github.com/smf-prdx/smf-mod-fixsmileybtn/releases)
2. Download the `.zip` package
3. Upload and install via the [Package Manager](https://wiki.simplemachines.org/smf/SMF2.1:Package_manager) in your SMF admin panel

## ⚠️ Limitations

This module is a practical quick-fix — a minimal CSS hack that prioritizes usability over aesthetics. While the button's position may feel a bit cramped near the popup's edge and the styling isn’t pixel-perfect, the focus is entirely on functionality. It ensures the Close button remains readily accessible in the smiley popup, even when navigating through large smiley sets.

💡 _It’s not a beauty queen — but it gets the job done._
